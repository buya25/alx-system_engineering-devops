# Project Postmortem README

## Overview

Any software system is susceptible to failures, and understanding and learning from those failures is crucial for continuous improvement. This project focuses on the concept of postmortems, a widely used tool in the tech industry to analyze and document incidents. A postmortem serves two primary goals: informing the organization about the outage's cause and ensuring that measures are taken to prevent its recurrence.

## Resources

Before diving into the project, familiarize yourself with the importance and structure of incident postmortems:

- [Incident Report, also referred to as a Postmortem](#)
- [The importance of an incident postmortem process](#)
- [What is an Incident Postmortem?](#)

Additionally, a [manual QA review](#) is required. Ensure that your postmortem undergoes peer review before the project deadline.

## Tasks

### Task 0: My First Postmortem

#### Requirements:

1. **Issue Summary:**
   - Duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone).
   - Impact assessment (affected service, user experiences, percentage of users impacted).
   - Root cause identification.

2. **Timeline:**
   - Detection time.
   - How the issue was detected (monitoring alert, engineer observation, customer complaint).
   - Actions taken (areas investigated, assumptions on root cause).
   - Misleading investigation/debugging paths.
   - Teams/individuals involved and escalation details.
   - Incident resolution details.

3. **Root Cause and Resolution:**
   - Detailed explanation of the issue's cause.
   - Detailed explanation of how the issue was fixed.

4. **Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
   - Broad improvements and fixes.
   - Specific tasks to address the issue (e.g., patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memory).
   - Keep the postmortem between 400 to 600 words.

### Task 1: Make People Want to Read Your Postmortem (Advanced)

In the vast sea of information, grabbing the audience's attention is essential. Add elements that make your postmortem attractive, such as humor, a visually appealing diagram, or any engaging content.

Please ensure that the blog is written in English to enhance your technical communication skills.

## Project Postmortem - Example

### Issue Summary

- **Duration:** 2 hours (Jan 20, 2024, 14:00 - 16:00 UTC)
- **Impact:**
  - Service: Web Stack
  - User Experience: Slow response times, 30% of users affected
- **Root Cause:** Database connection pool exhaustion

### Timeline

- **Detection Time:** 14:00 UTC
- **Detection Method:** Monitoring alert on increased response times
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated database performance
  - Assumed high traffic as the root cause
  - Explored frontend issues
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Explored server memory issues initially
  - Suspected DDoS attack without evidence
- **Escalation:**
  - Escalated to Database and Network Teams
- **Resolution:**
  - Increased database connection pool size

### Root Cause and Resolution

- **Cause:** Inadequate database connection pool size
- **Resolution:** Adjusted connection pool size to accommodate traffic spikes

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated monitoring for database connection pools
  - Conduct regular load testing to identify scalability issues
- **Specific Tasks:**
  - Update database connection pool configurations
  - Implement automated alerts for potential connection pool exhaustion
